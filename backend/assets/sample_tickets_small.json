    "description": "Current API rate limit of 100 requests/minute insufficient for enterprise customer integrations requiring batch operations. Customer 'TechCorp Solutions' (Account ID: ENT-7891, $25K/month) needs to sync 5,000+ tickets daily from their CRM system. Bulk import job requires 847 API calls taking 8.47 minutes minimum due to rate limiting. Integration timeouts after 5 minutes causing partial data imports. Rate limit headers: X-RateLimit-Limit: 100, X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0, X-RateLimit-Reset: 60. Competitor Zendesk offers 200 requests/minute for similar tier. API endpoint /v2/tickets/bulk accepts maximum 50 tickets per request. Customer's integration runs 4 times daily (6AM, 12PM, 6PM, 12AM EST) but only 2 succeed. Business impact: delayed ticket resolution, incomplete reporting, frustrated enterprise customers threatening contract non-renewal."

    "description": "File upload system rejecting attachments larger than 10MB causing customer frustration with documentation sharing. Current implementation uses multer middleware with 10MB hard limit in server.js line 67. Customer requests: architectural diagrams (average 24MB), video recordings (45-120MB), database dumps (156MB), and system logs (up to 500MB). 234 upload failures recorded in past 14 days with error 'File size exceeds maximum allowed size of 10485760 bytes'. AWS S3 bucket configuration supports up to 5TB per object. Competitors allow: Zendesk (50MB), ServiceNow (25MB), Freshdesk (15MB). Infrastructure cost analysis: increasing to 100MB limit would cost additional $47/month in S3 storage. Technical implementation requires updating: client-side validation, server middleware, and database schema for file_size column."

Temporary workaround: manual PDF regeneration taking 3-4 hours per billing cycle."
